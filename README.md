# Outlier detection using robust PCA methods
Bachelor's thesis for Engineering Physics and Mathematics in Aalto University School of Science

## Abstract
In this thesis we apply the robust principal component analysis methods ROBPCA and its
modification for skewed data to two asymmetric and non-Gaussian data sets from the field of
production engineering. The outliers are identified by their large deviation from the robust center
of the data, and the subspace spanned by the robust principal components. Finally, we analyze the
robust principal components to gain a better understanding of the sources of variation in the data.
The quality of our models is assessed by visualization methods.
As expected, the skew-adjusted algorithm proves to be more accurate in detecting the anomalous
observations. The ROBPCA algorithm falsely identifies regular observations located in the tail area
of skewed distributions as anomalies. We identify both univariate and multivariate outliers. The
complete decomposition contribution (CDC) indices prove to be effective in describing the effect of
each variable on the large deviation of the outliers.
The findings in this thesis lay the groundwork for further analysis of the data. In the wider context
of improving production processes, robust logistic regression methods could be used to determine
whether the measurement phenomena responsible for the outlying observations have negative
connotations.
